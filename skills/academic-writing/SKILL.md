# Academic Writing Skill

This skill provides comprehensive support for academic writing and manuscript preparation.

## Core Capabilities

### Reviewer's Perspective (Self-Check)

Always write from a reviewer's perspective:

1. **10-minute test**: Can key points be grasped quickly?
2. **Logic chain**: Does motivation → contribution logic hold?
3. **3-sentence test**: Can main contribution be explained briefly?
4. **Experiment validation**: Do experiments support the motivation?
5. **Consistency**: Is the logic consistent throughout all sections?

### Presentation Hierarchy

**图 > 表 > Algorithm > 公式 > 文字** (Figure > Table > Algorithm > Equation > Text)

### 1. Manuscript Structure

Guide proper organization of research papers:

- **IMRAD format**: Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion
- **Title and Abstract**: Concise, informative summaries
- **Introduction**: Background, gap, objectives
- **Methods**: Detailed procedures for reproducibility
- **Results**: Objective presentation of findings
- **Discussion**: Interpretation, implications, limitations
- **Conclusion**: Summary and future directions

### 2. Section-Specific Writing
Specialized support for each manuscript section:
- **Abstract**: Structured or unstructured, 150-250 words
- **Introduction**: Funnel approach from broad to specific
- **Literature Review**: Critical synthesis of existing work
- **Methods**: Step-by-step description of procedures
- **Results**: Data presentation with tables and figures
- **Discussion**: Interpretation in context of literature
- **Conclusion**: Key takeaways and implications

### 3. Academic Language
Improve clarity and scholarly tone:
- Precise terminology
- Appropriate hedging language
- Clear, concise sentences
- Proper use of active/passive voice
- Formal academic tone
- Avoidance of colloquialisms

### 4. Argumentation
Build compelling academic arguments:
- Clear thesis statements
- Logical flow of ideas
- Evidence-based claims
- Counterargument acknowledgment
- Coherent transitions

- `assets/methods-checklist.md` - 30+ checkpoints for Methods
- `assets/results-checklist.md` - 30+ checkpoints for Results
- `assets/discussion-checklist.md` - 49 checkpoints for Discussion

### Templates and Examples

- `assets/manuscript-template.md` - Standard research paper structure
- `assets/abstract-template.md` - Structured abstract format

## Workflow Patterns

### Manuscript Drafting Workflow

1. **Planning**:
   - Define target journal
   - Review journal guidelines
   - Outline main arguments
   - Organize figures and tables

2. **First Draft**:
   - Write Methods section first (most straightforward)
   - Draft Results with reference to figures/tables
   - Write Introduction and Discussion together
   - Draft Abstract last

3. **Revision**:
   - Check logical flow
   - Verify all claims have support
   - Eliminate redundancy
   - Improve clarity and conciseness
   - Align with journal requirements

4. **Polishing**:
   - Grammar and spelling check
   - Consistent terminology
   - Proper citation formatting
   - Reference list completeness
   - Figure/table quality

### Abstract Writing Workflow

1. **Structure** (for structured abstracts):
   - Background: 1-2 sentences
   - Objective: 1 sentence
   - Methods: 2-3 sentences
   - Results: 2-3 sentences
   - Conclusions: 1-2 sentences

2. **Writing**:
   - Start with objective
   - Summarize key methods
   - Report main findings with numbers
   - State main conclusion
   - Stay within word limit

3. **Refinement**:
   - Remove unnecessary words
   - Ensure standalone comprehension
   - Check keyword inclusion
   - Verify accuracy

## Best Practices

### Introduction Section
- Start broad, narrow to specific
- Clearly state research gap
- Define objectives and hypotheses
- Justify study importance
- Preview structure (optional)

### Methods Section
- Organize chronologically or by category
- Include enough detail for replication
- Cite established methods
- Describe novel methods in detail
- State ethical approval
- Mention statistical analyses

### Results Section
- Present findings objectively
- Refer to all figures and tables
- Report statistics properly
- No interpretation (save for Discussion)
- Organize logically (by hypothesis or theme)

### Discussion Section

Use the 5-step framework (see `references/discussion-guide.md`):
1. Summarize current research findings
2. Relate results to existing literature
3. Discuss unexpected findings
4. Connect to broader theoretical implications
5. Address study limitations constructively

Each step includes 10-15 common phrases and before/after examples.

## Integration with Other Tools

- **Citation Management**: Use academic-research skill for citations
- **Data Presentation**: Use data-visualization skill for figures
- **Version Control**: Track manuscript versions with git
- **Collaboration**: Share drafts with co-authors

## Example Usage

When user requests: "Help me write the introduction for my paper on renewable energy"

Process:
1. Understand research focus and main findings
2. Structure introduction funnel:
   - Broad context (energy transition importance)
   - Current state (renewable adoption challenges)
   - Research gap (specific unexplored aspect)
   - Study purpose and objectives
3. Draft introduction following structure
4. Include relevant citations
5. End with clear research questions or hypotheses

When user requests: "Improve this methods section for clarity"

Process:
1. Read existing methods section
2. Check for completeness:
   - Study design clearly stated
   - Sample/participants described
   - Procedures explained step-by-step
   - Measurements/instruments specified
   - Statistical analysis detailed
3. Improve organization and flow
4. Enhance clarity and precision
5. Ensure reproducibility

Always maintain academic rigor and appropriate scholarly tone.
