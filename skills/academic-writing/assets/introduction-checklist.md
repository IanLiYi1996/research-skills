# Introduction Section Checklist

Use this checklist while drafting and revising your Introduction. For detailed guidance, see [introduction-guide.md](../references/introduction-guide.md).

---

## Pre-Writing

- [ ] Identified 3-5 main contributions to highlight
- [ ] Listed 5-10 key related papers to cite
- [ ] Clarified the specific research gap your work addresses
- [ ] Determined target audience (specialists vs. broader community)
- [ ] Reviewed journal/conference introduction examples from your field

---

## Stage 1: Opening Context

- [ ] Opened with compelling, specific statement (not generic cliché like "In recent years...")
- [ ] Established broad importance of research area
- [ ] Used concrete examples, statistics, or applications when possible
- [ ] Connected to real-world problems or societal needs
- [ ] Engaged both specialist and non-specialist readers
- [ ] Avoided unnecessary jargon in opening paragraph
- [ ] Started broad enough to be accessible, specific enough to be interesting

---

## Stage 2: Prior Work and Current State

- [ ] Cited 5-10 key related papers (not exhaustive—that's for Related Work)
- [ ] Grouped approaches thematically rather than just chronologically
- [ ] Acknowledged strengths of existing work fairly
- [ ] Used varied transitional phrases (several approaches, recent work, etc.)
- [ ] Identified patterns or commonalities across prior approaches
- [ ] Maintained professional tone (not dismissive of prior work)
- [ ] Set up natural transition to limitations/gaps

---

## Stage 3: Research Gap Identification

- [ ] Specified clear, concrete limitation(s) of existing work
- [ ] Used diplomatic hedging language ("less attention," "remains challenging")
- [ ] Explained why the gap matters (connected to real problem or need)
- [ ] Avoided dismissive language ("fails to," "ignores," "unfortunately")
- [ ] Made gap specific enough to motivate your exact contribution
- [ ] Ensured gap naturally leads to your proposed approach
- [ ] Quantified scope of problem when possible

---

## Stage 4: Proposed Approach Overview

- [ ] Provided high-level description of solution (coarse-grained first)
- [ ] Explained key insight or intuition behind approach
- [ ] Highlighted what makes approach different from prior work
- [ ] Used 1-2 paragraphs (not too long, not too technical)
- [ ] Saved detailed technical specifications for Methods section
- [ ] Explained "why this should work" not just "what you do"
- [ ] Made approach sound natural and motivated (not arbitrary)
- [ ] Avoided excessive technical jargon at this stage

---

## Stage 5: Contributions

- [ ] Listed 3-5 specific contributions (not more, not fewer)
- [ ] Used bullet points for clarity
- [ ] Made each contribution concrete and verifiable
- [ ] Ordered contributions by importance or logical flow
- [ ] Distinguished between different contribution types (methods, findings, resources)
- [ ] Each contribution is independently valuable
- [ ] Avoided vague claims ("we improve," "we analyze")—instead used specifics ("we achieve 15% higher accuracy," "we release dataset of X samples")
- [ ] Contributions match those validated in Conclusion
- [ ] Used strong, clear language ("we propose," "we demonstrate," "we release")

---

## Stage 6: Paper Organization (Optional)

- [ ] Included roadmap only if paper structure is complex or non-standard
- [ ] Kept organization description brief (2-4 sentences max)
- [ ] Listed sections in order with brief purpose for each
- [ ] Considered omitting if space is tight (common in conferences)

---

## Overall Structure and Flow

- [ ] Follows clear funnel structure: broad → narrow → your work
- [ ] Smooth transitions between stages (context → prior work → gap → your approach → contributions)
- [ ] Each paragraph has clear focus and purpose
- [ ] Logical flow from motivation to contribution
- [ ] Introduction is self-contained (can be understood without reading rest of paper)
- [ ] Length is appropriate (1-2 pages for conferences, 2-4 for journals)
- [ ] No technical details that belong in Methods
- [ ] No results that belong in Results/Discussion

---

## Language and Style

- [ ] Opened with strong, engaging hook (not weak or generic)
- [ ] Used active voice where appropriate ("We propose..." not "A method is proposed...")
- [ ] Varied sentence structure (mix of simple and complex sentences)
- [ ] Employed appropriate hedging ("typically," "often") not absolute claims ("always," "never")
- [ ] Avoided contractions (don't → do not, can't → cannot)
- [ ] Minimized vague terms ("very," "quite," "some")
- [ ] Used consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Maintained professional, confident tone (not apologetic or overselling)

---

## Citations and Prior Work

- [ ] Cited 5-10 key papers in Introduction (comprehensive coverage in Related Work)
- [ ] Citations are recent and relevant (mostly within last 3-5 years for fast-moving fields)
- [ ] Used citation format correctly (\citep{} for parenthetical, \citet{} for in-text)
- [ ] Acknowledged prior work fairly (not dismissive or overly critical)
- [ ] Avoided orphan citations (cited but not discussed)
- [ ] Citations support claims being made

---

## Consistency with Other Sections

- [ ] Contributions listed match those validated in Conclusion
- [ ] Abstract and Introduction tell consistent story
- [ ] Research gap identified is addressed by your work
- [ ] Terminology introduced here is used consistently throughout
- [ ] Methods section provides technical details promised here
- [ ] No contradictions between Introduction and other sections

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- [ ] Not starting too narrow (engage broad audience first)
- [ ] Not dismissing or undervaluing prior work
- [ ] Not listing vague or unverifiable contributions
- [ ] Not failing to identify clear research gap
- [ ] Not including excessive technical detail (save for Methods)
- [ ] Not opening with cliché ("In recent years..." "With the development of...")
- [ ] Not overclaiming ("completely solve," "for the first time ever")
- [ ] Not being too modest ("we try to," "we attempt to")

---

## Clarity and Accessibility

- [ ] Can a colleague in your field understand main points without reading full paper?
- [ ] Can a smart non-specialist grasp the general problem and contribution?
- [ ] Is the research gap clear and compelling?
- [ ] Are contributions specific enough to be verifiable?
- [ ] Is the motivation for your work convincing?
- [ ] Would a busy reviewer quickly understand why this work matters?

---

## Final Checks

- [ ] Read entire Introduction aloud to check flow
- [ ] Verified all citations are correct and formatted properly
- [ ] Checked that contributions are numbered consistently (if numbered)
- [ ] Ensured no typos, grammatical errors, or formatting issues
- [ ] Had colleague review for clarity and persuasiveness
- [ ] Confirmed alignment with journal/conference requirements (length, structure)
- [ ] Verified that opening paragraph is engaging and specific
- [ ] Double-checked that research gap is clearly articulated
- [ ] Ensured contributions are concrete and verifiable

## Quick Self-Assessment Questions

1. **Hook**: Does the opening paragraph make someone want to keep reading?
2. **Clarity**: Can I explain my contribution in one sentence?
3. **Gap**: Is it crystal clear what's missing or limited in prior work?
4. **Specificity**: Are my contributions concrete enough that a skeptic could verify them?
5. **Flow**: Does each paragraph naturally lead to the next?
6. **Motivation**: Would a reviewer think this problem is worth solving?

If you answered "yes" to all six, your Introduction is in excellent shape!

**Pro Tip**: The Introduction is often written last (after you've completed experiments and know exactly what you achieved). Don't let a weak Introduction draft discourage you early—focus on getting results first, then craft a compelling story around them!
