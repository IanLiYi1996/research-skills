## PRISMA Guidelines for Systematic Reviews

PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) provides a structured approach to conducting systematic literature reviews.

### Four Main Phases

#### 1. Identification
Define your search strategy and identify potential papers:
- **Databases**: Select appropriate databases (PubMed, IEEE, ACM, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar)
- **Search Terms**: Develop comprehensive search strings using:
  - Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
  - Wildcards (* for word variations)
  - Field-specific searches (title, abstract, keywords)
- **Date Range**: Specify publication date range
- **Language**: Define language restrictions
- **Documentation**: Record search strategy, dates, and results count

#### 2. Screening
Review papers for relevance:
- **Title/Abstract Screening**: Quick initial filter
- **Inclusion Criteria**: Papers must meet ALL criteria
- **Exclusion Criteria**: Papers with ANY of these are excluded
- **Independent Reviewers**: Use 2+ reviewers for reliability
- **Conflict Resolution**: Define process for disagreements
- **Documentation**: Track reasons for exclusion

#### 3. Eligibility
Assess full-text articles:
- **Full-Text Review**: Read complete papers
- **Detailed Criteria**: Apply inclusion/exclusion rigorously
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate study quality
- **Data Extraction Readiness**: Ensure papers have necessary data
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed notes

#### 4. Inclusion
Select final papers for review:
- **Final Set**: Papers meeting all criteria
- **Data Extraction**: Use standardized forms
- **Synthesis**: Combine findings across papers
- **Documentation**: Complete paper list with reasons for inclusion

     quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)
                (n = ...)

## Research Quality Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate each paper:

### Overall Quality Rating
- **High**: All or most criteria met, minimal bias risk
- **Moderate**: Some criteria met, moderate bias risk
- **Low**: Few criteria met, high bias risk
- **Unclear**: Insufficient information to assess

### Specific Quality Dimensions

**Internal Validity**: Does the study establish causation?
- Clear research question
- Appropriate design
- Control of confounds
- Proper randomization (if applicable)

**External Validity**: Are results generalizable?
- Representative sample
- Real-world relevance
- Diverse population
- Multiple settings (if applicable)

**Construct Validity**: Do measures assess what they claim?
- Valid instruments
- Established scales
- Appropriate operationalization

**Reliability**: Are results consistent and reproducible?
- Clear methods
- Standardized procedures
- Inter-rater reliability (if applicable)
- Test-retest reliability (if applicable)

## Common Bias Types

### Selection Bias
**Definition**: Systematic differences in baseline characteristics between groups

**Signs**:
- Non-random allocation
- Inadequate concealment
- Different baseline characteristics

**Assessment**: Compare group characteristics at baseline

### Performance Bias
**Definition**: Systematic differences in care provided to groups

**Signs**:
- Lack of blinding
- Different protocols for groups
- Differential treatment

**Assessment**: Check for blinding and standardization

### Detection Bias
**Definition**: Systematic differences in outcome assessment

**Signs**:
- Unblinded outcome assessment
- Different measurement methods
- Subjective outcomes without blinding

**Assessment**: Verify blinded assessment

### Attrition Bias
**Definition**: Systematic differences in withdrawals between groups

**Signs**:
- High dropout rates
- Differential attrition
- Missing outcome data
- No intention-to-treat analysis

**Assessment**: Check completion rates and handling of missing data

### Reporting Bias
**Definition**: Selective reporting of outcomes

**Signs**:
- Outcomes mentioned in methods but not reported
- Post-hoc analyses
- Selective time-point reporting
- Publication bias (favoring positive results)

**Assessment**: Compare protocol to published paper

## Evidence Synthesis Methods

### Narrative Synthesis
Describe findings across studies qualitatively:
- Group by theme or outcome
- Describe patterns and trends
- Note contradictions
- Assess consistency
- Consider study quality

### Meta-Analysis
Combine quantitative results statistically:
- Calculate pooled effect sizes
- Assess heterogeneity (I² statistic)
- Conduct sensitivity analyses
- Check for publication bias (funnel plots)
- Perform subgroup analyses

### Framework Synthesis
Map findings to theoretical framework:
- Identify relevant frameworks
- Code papers to framework elements
- Identify gaps in framework
- Propose framework refinements

## Reporting Standards

### Transparency
- Document all decisions
- Report complete search strategy
- Provide study selection flow diagram
- List excluded studies with reasons
- Share data extraction forms

### Reproducibility

- Search strings provided
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria explicit
- Quality assessment tools specified
- Analysis code available (if applicable)

### Completeness
- Register protocol (PROSPERO)
- Follow reporting guidelines (PRISMA)
