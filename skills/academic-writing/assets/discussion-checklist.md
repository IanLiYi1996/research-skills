# Discussion Section Checklist

Use this checklist while drafting and revising your Discussion section. For detailed guidance on each item, see [discussion-guide.md](../references/discussion-guide.md).

---

## Pre-Writing (Before You Start)

- [ ] Reviewed all Results section content thoroughly
- [ ] Listed 3-5 main findings to discuss in order of importance
- [ ] Identified 5-7 relevant studies for comparison and contextualization
- [ ] Noted any unexpected or counter-intuitive findings that need explanation
- [ ] Brainstormed 2-3 theoretical implications or practical applications
- [ ] Listed 3-4 genuine limitations (methodological boundaries, not minor flaws)

---

## Step 1: Summarize Current Research

- [ ] Opened Discussion with concise summary of main findings (2-4 sentences)
- [ ] Avoided repeating Results section verbatim or citing specific numbers excessively
- [ ] Explicitly connected summary to original research questions or hypotheses
- [ ] Used appropriate certainty language (demonstrates, suggests, indicates—not "proves")
- [ ] Did not introduce any new data or results not mentioned in Results section
- [ ] Provided high-level interpretation, not just restatement of findings

---

## Step 2: Relate Results to Existing Literature

- [ ] Compared findings with at least 3-5 highly relevant studies
- [ ] Acknowledged findings that align with previous research, citing specific studies
- [ ] Addressed any findings that diverge from or contradict prior work
- [ ] Provided plausible explanations for discrepancies (methodological, contextual, etc.)
- [ ] Showed how work builds upon, extends, or complements existing research
- [ ] Highlighted what makes contribution unique or novel compared to prior work
- [ ] Integrated citations throughout discussion, not just at the beginning
- [ ] Been fair to prior work (not only citing studies you agree with)
- [ ] Used varied transitional phrases (consistent with, in contrast to, building on, etc.)

---

## Step 3: Address Unexpected Findings (if applicable)

- [ ] Identified genuinely unexpected results (those contradicting hypotheses or intuition)
- [ ] Provided plausible, evidence-based explanations for unexpected findings
- [ ] Discussed potential methodological factors that might explain surprises
- [ ] Framed unexpected findings constructively (as learning opportunities, not failures)
- [ ] Avoided defensive or dismissive language about unexpected results
- [ ] Connected unexpected findings to broader theoretical implications when possible

---

## Step 4: Connect to Broader Theoretical Implications

- [ ] Linked specific findings to relevant theoretical frameworks or models
- [ ] Explained how findings advance understanding of the phenomenon studied
- [ ] Discussed at least 1-2 practical applications or real-world implications
- [ ] Articulated what the findings mean for the field beyond this specific study
- [ ] Balanced specificity (grounded in your results) with generality (broader significance)
- [ ] Addressed both theoretical contributions and practical utility
- [ ] Avoided overgeneralizing beyond what the data support
- [ ] Connected results to ongoing debates or open questions in the field (if applicable)

---

## Step 5: Address Limitations

- [ ] Listed 3-5 main limitations (genuine methodological constraints, not minor issues)
- [ ] Framed each limitation constructively (boundary of generalization, not fatal flaw)
- [ ] Explained how each limitation might affect interpretation of results
- [ ] Connected limitations to specific future research directions
- [ ] Maintained confidence in core contributions despite acknowledging limits
- [ ] Avoided excessive self-criticism or self-defeating language
- [ ] Distinguished between limitations (unavoidable boundaries) and weaknesses (correctable flaws)
- [ ] Did not introduce limitations that completely undermine your contribution
- [ ] Provided context for why certain limitations exist (practical, ethical, or resource constraints)

---

## Overall Quality and Structure

- [ ] Discussion follows logical flow from summary → literature → implications → limitations
- [ ] Each paragraph has clear topic sentence and focused content
- [ ] Transitional phrases connect paragraphs smoothly (building on, another consideration, etc.)
- [ ] No contradictions between Discussion and other sections (especially Introduction/Results)
- [ ] Used appropriate hedging language (suggests, indicates) rather than absolute claims (proves, always)
- [ ] Discussion is clear and accessible (avoids unnecessary jargon)
- [ ] Length is appropriate (typically 20-30% of paper, balancing depth with conciseness)
- [ ] All claims are either supported by your data or cited from literature
- [ ] Discussion provides interpretation and insight, not just summary
- [ ] Future work suggestions are specific and actionable (not vague like "more research needed")
- [ ] Discussion addresses "so what?"—why findings matter beyond immediate results
- [ ] Concludes with strong takeaway message that sets up Conclusion section

---

## Integration with Other Sections

- [ ] Discussion addresses all research questions/hypotheses posed in Introduction
- [ ] Findings relate to gaps identified in Introduction
- [ ] Contributions claimed in Introduction are substantiated in Discussion
- [ ] All Results are interpreted (nothing presented in Results but ignored in Discussion)
- [ ] Specific Results (tables, figures) are referenced when interpreting them
- [ ] Consistency in terminology and claims across Abstract, Introduction, Results, Discussion

---

## Language and Style

- [ ] Used active voice where appropriate ("We found that..." not "It was found that...")
- [ ] Varied sentence structure (mix of simple and complex sentences)
- [ ] Eliminated redundant phrases and unnecessary words
- [ ] Avoided absolute statements ("always," "never," "proves")—used nuanced language
- [ ] Used consistent terminology (not switching between "method," "approach," "technique" randomly)
- [ ] Minimized use of ambiguous pronouns (it, they, this)—clarified referents
- [ ] Employed discipline-appropriate tone and conventions
- [ ] Checked that all technical terms are defined or previously introduced

---

## Final Checks (Before Submission)

- [ ] Read entire Discussion aloud to check flow and clarity
- [ ] Verified all citations are correct and in proper format
- [ ] Confirmed Discussion doesn't repeat Results section content unnecessarily
- [ ] Ensured no new data or results are introduced in Discussion
- [ ] Had colleague or advisor review for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Checked that Discussion aligns with journal/conference requirements (length, structure)
- [ ] Eliminated any remaining typos, grammatical errors, or formatting issues
- [ ] Verified that figures/tables referenced in Discussion match those in Results
- [ ] Confirmed that limitations don't overshadow contributions
- [ ] Double-checked that all future work suggestions are feasible and specific

## Quick Self-Assessment Questions

Ask yourself these questions as a final gut-check:

1. **Clarity**: Can a colleague in my field understand my main arguments without reading the entire paper?
2. **Depth**: Have I gone beyond summarizing to truly interpreting what the findings mean?
3. **Context**: Have I positioned my work appropriately within existing literature?
4. **Honesty**: Have I acknowledged limitations without undermining my contribution?
5. **Impact**: Is it clear why my findings matter and what comes next?
6. **Coherence**: Does the Discussion tell a logical story from findings to implications?

If you answered "yes" to all six, your Discussion is likely in good shape!

**Pro Tip**: Use this checklist iteratively. On first draft, focus on Steps 1-5 and overall structure. On revision, pay more attention to language, integration, and final checks. Don't expect to satisfy every checkbox on the first pass!
