## Academic Writing Standards

### Avoid Contractions
- `don't` → `do not`
- `it's` → `it is`
- `can't` → `cannot`
- `we've` → `we have`

### Possessive Conversion
- `method's performance` → `performance of the method`
- `model's structure` → `structure of the model`

### Latin Expressions
- `e.g.,` - for example (always with comma)
- `i.e.,` - that is (always with comma)
- `et al.` - and others (for citations)
- `etc.` - and so on (not for people)

Note: `et al.` or `etc.` at sentence end needs no extra period.

### Avoid Absolute Statements

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| obvious | straightforward |
| always | generally, usually, often |
| never | rarely, seldom |
| avoid, eliminate | alleviate, relieve |
| prove | demonstrate, show, indicate |
| best | effective, promising |

### Be Specific, Not Vague
- Avoid vague terms: "meaning", "semantic", "better"
- When claiming something is "better", explain specifically what improved and why

### Sentence Structure
- **One idea per sentence**: Prefer simple sentences over complex compounds
- **Minimize pronouns**: Use specific names (model name, method name) instead of "it", "they"
- **Separate concerns**: Don't mix observations, hypotheses, methods, and results in one sentence

### Article Usage (a/an/the)
- `an LSTM` (L sounds like "el")
- `an F1 score` (F sounds like "ef")
- `a URL` (U sounds like "you")
- `a unified model`

Singular countable nouns need either `the` (specific) or plural form (general).

### Paragraph Layout
- If last line is less than 1/4 width, consider editing
- Don't repeat figure/table captions in main text
- Caption: what it IS; Main text: what it MEANS

Focus on clarity, logical flow, and adherence to academic writing conventions. Help researchers communicate their work effectively to scholarly audiences.
